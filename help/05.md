# Delete data

## Deleting Data in JS

```javascript
firebase.database().ref('tasks/xyz890').set(null)

// --- or ---

firebase.database().ref('tasks/xyz890').remove()
```

You can _set_ the data at a given path to `null`, effectively deleting
it. Be warned that this can be the cause of bugs - accidentally passing `null`
to `.set()` when you meant to pass an object!

Alternatively, you can explicitly use the `.remove()` method to delete data a
given path.
