# A TODO List

Using the CRUD skills we've now learned on top of Firebase's BaaS (Backend as a
Service), we can create our first app with persistent data!

Uncomment the HTML in `index.html` to get started.

**Create**

The goal is to allow a user to enter a new TODO item, and click "Add". This will
save the item to the database in Firebase.

**Read**

As new items are added to the list, it should be re-rendered. If the page is
refreshed, the list of items should be received from Firebase and rendered.

**Update**

The user should be able to mark an item from the list as _Done_, updating the
appropriate field in the database.

_Hint: Give each item in the list a checkbox, then [listen to the `change`
event](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4471462/473961)._

**Delete**

Items should be able to be removed from the list. When the user does so, it
should be removed from the database.

Once done, move on to [step 07 - Authentication](07.md).
