# Firebase v3 Setup & Tutorial

This workshop will walk you through setting up and creating a simple CRUD app
using Firebase v3.

The majority of the workshop relies you the reader to figure out how the code
will fit into your application - the only things provided are the specific
functions you need to call for performing any of the CRUD actions.

There is a starter `index.html` and `app.js` file provided to get you started.

## Getting Started

Begin by "forking" this starter code repository. You can do so by clicking the
"Fork" icon on the top right of [this
page](https://github.com/jesstelford/firebase-workshop). Once complete, clone
the repository to your computer by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username-here>/firebase-workshop.git
cd firebase-workshop
```
